Section 1: Install Ubuntu
1. Install Ubuntu 12.04 server and update to the latest state;
2. Copy file "interfaces" to overwrite /etc/network/interfaces.
   Thus we have 2 lan port:
   eth0: 192.168.16.1/255.255.255.0 used to connect to AP board. DHCP is running on this port.
   eth1: 10.0.0.100/255.255.255.0 used to debug. You can use ssh to connect to this port.

Section 2: Support 3G card:
1. Configure to support 3G card:
   sudo apt-get install network-manager
   Copy "China Unicom Default" to /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections
   Copy start3g.sh to /etc
   Add "/etc/start3g.sh&" to /etc/rc.local
   This script is to detect Unicom 3G card and config the modem automatically.
2. Restart and you can make both 3g modems working(Unicom and ChinaNet) 

Section 3: IP forward
1. Install package isc-dhcp-server
2. Copy dhcpd.conf to overwrite /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
3. Copy startforward.sh to /etc
   This script is to detect the 3G card and config iptables.
4. Add "/etc/startforward.sh&" to /etc/rc.local
5. Restart and the board can work as a NAT router.
